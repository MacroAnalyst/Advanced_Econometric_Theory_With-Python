# Advanced Qantitative Methods
This is a training session of advanced quantitative methods, including advanced econometric and statistical theory, time series analysis, Bayesian econometrics/statistics and etc. The course is prepared for senior quantitative analysts/researchers, also perfect for grad student who are interested in quantitative theory and methods in industry. 

## Prerequisites
The courses are not for beginners, the attendees must have working knowledge of linear algrebra, statistics and probability.

And also the attendees are expected to have some exposure of

- [x] Python
- [x] NumPy
- [x] Matplotlib
- [x] Statsmodels
- [x] Pandas

In order to reuse some codes in simulation loop, Oject Orient Programming are used but limitedly.
